# Difficulty: 35%

# QUESTION:

    # The following undirected network consists of seven vertices and twelve edges with a total weight of 243.
    #
    # The same matrix can be represented by the matrix below.
    #
    # However, it is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges and still ensure that all points
    # on the network remain connected. The network which achieves the maximum saving is shown below. It has a
    # weight of 93, representing a saving of 243 âˆ’ 93 = 150 from the original network.
    #
    # Using network.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 6K text file containing a network with
    # forty vertices, and given in matrix form, find the maximum saving which can be achieved by removing
    # redundant edges whilst ensuring that the network remains connected.

# FINISHED

# WHAT I LEARNED:

    # I completed this task relatively quickly and it has reinforced many concepts, the first being the value of have many smaller helper functions.
    # Furthermore I got practice with both classes and graphs which I was in need of.
    # I also got a nice confidence boost since my first attempt at the logic to solve this problem ended up being correct.
    # I enjoyed working with this graph model.

    # Above all print statements were paramount in debugging this code and I found when I had a ton of them, that's when I was making the most progress.
    # I must remember that when referring to class objects, although two objects may have the same "name", the objects themselves are different.
    # I wrote the getNode() function for the digraph class for this reason, since I wanted to call the objects by "name", so I had to find them somehow.
    # This was also my first time using sets and the associated set functions made my life much easier.









#The file network.txt contains data that pertains to a n x n matrix representing edges (entries) between nodes (represented by position).
#What I want to do is minimize the value of edges needed for the entire network to be connected.
#I need return the decrease in edge value from the original network.


#Tasks:

    #1 - Read the network.txt data.

        #I think this would be best done wit a dictionary with nodes for keys and the entries being a list of the connections.

    #2 - Create the map model.

        #I need to remember that this is a undirected graph.
        #Gave up on writing my own graph code pretty much immediately.

    #3 - Create an optimization algorithm

        #This seems to me like a breadth-first type search, however there are off shoots so it will not be the same.
